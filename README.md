# Network Classification and Model Comparison

This project explores the classification of different types of networks and investigates whether networks of the same type follow the same model. The analysis includes biological, social, and technological networks, and uses various statistical measures to determine the appropriate network model for each case.

The goal is to classify different types of networks and observe if there's a tendency to follow specific models like Barab√°si-Albert, Erdos-Renyi, or Small World.

Network Types Analyzed

- Biological Networks: Networks based on biological interactions.
- Social Networks: Networks based on social interactions and user trust.
- Technological Networks: Networks related to technological infrastructures, such as Bitcoin and others.
